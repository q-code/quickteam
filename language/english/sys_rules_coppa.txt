<p><b>COPPA Policy</b></p>
<p>All users under the age of 13 must seek permission from their parent or guardian in order to gain membership of a community. While this site applies the COPPA policy, to welcome members under 13, we require that a parent or guardian fax or mail back a signed permission form before we grant this children as member and we make personal info visible on the web.</p>
<p>You can continue the registration process but the account will be activated only after we received a signed permission form. If you would like to cancel the registration, click <a href="index.php">here</a> to return to the team index.</p>
<p>A copy of the permission form is available <a href="qte_form_coppa.php">here</a>.<br />More info on COPPA: <a href="http://www.coppa.org">www.coppa.org</a></p>
